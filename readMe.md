This is a Ping-Pong project assigned by AccelerateHK

I will divide the project into smaller tasks and document the smaller steps here.

HTML part
  1) HTML is going to contain a jumbotron with the title Ping-Pong
  2) it will also contain a div (grey box in the example)
  3) the div will contain a green box that will float left with all the html details inside.
  4) the div will also contain the rest of the html lines in it together with the javascript logic described below.

  javascript part
    1) it will include a text box prompting an input from the user
    2) it will also include a button that accepts user's input and pass it onto the javascript logic
    3) javascript logic will include an if statement with the modular logic
    4)the webpage will print out all the logic

    css part
    1) try to make the webapp look better with presentation tools from jquery and bootstrap
